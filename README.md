## Architecture

RapidTools Hub follows a microservices architecture, providing modular and scalable services.
Here's a brief overview of our architecture:

### Microservices

- **URL Shortener Service:** Handles the URL shortening process efficiently.
- **Word Counter Service:** For counting words in text content.
- **Cut Tool Service:** For content cutting and manipulation.
- **Image Conversions Service:** Supports various image conversion operations.

### Database

We leverage databases to store necessary data for each service. For example, the URL Shortener service uses a database to store shortened URLs and their corresponding original URLs.

### Communication

The Frontend communicates with the Backend through RESTful APIs. We ensure seamless integration and data flow between microservices to provide a cohesive user experience.

### Scalability

Each microservice is designed to be independent, allowing for scalability based on the demand for specific services. Docker containers and orchestration tools facilitate easy deployment and scaling.
